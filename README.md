# Loan_application_risk_analysis
* Analysis Overview : This analysis aims to explore various aspects of loan default behavior, including how defaults vary across different demographic and financial features. * The key components of the analysis are as follows:

* Default by Age Bucket and Contract Type:
The data has been segmented into different age buckets to analyze default rates across age groups.
Default rates have also been examined in relation to different contract types to understand their impact on loan performance.

* Threshold Analysis: A maximum threshold has been established to tolerate loans within different categories, helping to identify outliers and high-risk segments.

* Feature Distribution:
The distribution of various features has been studied to understand their underlying patterns.
Some features have been converted into deciles for simplified and more effective analysis.

* Default Distribution Across Categories:
Default rates have been analyzed across multiple categories to identify trends and correlations.
The occupation type default distribution has been specifically examined to understand which job categories are more prone to default.

* Financial Analysis:
The relationship between default occurrence and different financial metrics, such as income and credit amount, has been analyzed.
Each application ID has been scrutinized to determine the maximum loan amount borrowed and the duration of the loan.

* Day Past Due Analysis: The maximum days past due for each application have been calculated to identify patterns in payment delays.

* Approval and Refusal Rates: The ratio of approved to refused loans has been computed for each application.
